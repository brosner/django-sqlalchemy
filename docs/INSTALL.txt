django-sqlalchemy Installation
==============================

This document covers how-to get django-sqlalchemy up and running your project.

Dependancies
------------

Make sure you have the following installed on your PYTHONPATH:

    * sqlalchemy 0.5 SVN -- svn co http://svn.sqlalchemy.org/sqlalchemy/trunk
    * django 1.0.X -- http://www.djangoproject.com/download/

Configuration
-------------

django-sqlalchemy depends on two settings that you need to put in your
settings.py file:

    * DATABASE_ENGINE
    * DJANGO_SQLALCHEMY_DBURI

``DATABASE_ENGINE`` must be set to ``django_sqlalchemy.backend``. This will
tell Django to load up all of our stuff to use as the database backend.
``DJANGO_SQLALCHEMY_DBURI`` is passed to SQLAlchemy's ``create_engine``. You
may also optionally set ``DJANGO_SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to True to tell SQLAlchemy
to be verbose. This is really only recommended during development only.
