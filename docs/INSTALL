django-sqlalchemy Installation
==============================

This document covers how-to get django-sqlalchemy up and running your project.

Dependancies
------------

Make sure you have the following installed on your PYTHONPATH:

    * sqlalchemy 0.4.5 -- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SQLAlchemy/0.4.5
    * django SVN r7477 or newer -- svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk

Configuration
-------------

django-sqlalchemy depends on two settings that you need to put in your
settings.py file:

    * DATABASE_ENGINE
    * DJANGO_SQLALCHEMY_DBURI

``DATABASE_ENGINE`` must be set to ``django_sqlalchemy.backend``. This will
tell Django to load up all of our stuff to use as the database backend.
``DJANGO_SQLALCHEMY_DBURI`` is passed to SQLAlchemy's ``create_engine``. You
may also optionally set ``DJANGO_SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to True to tell SQLAlchemy
to be verbose. This is really only recommended during development only.

Currently we require that all ``from django.db import models`` is changed to
``from django_sqlalchemy import models``. We have mapped all Django's fields
to their SQLAlchemy equivalents. We may eventually map this into Django or
provide a solution a little bit more involved, but for right now to get
things working we ask that this done by the user.
