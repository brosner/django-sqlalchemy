django-sqlalchemy Installation
==============================

This document covers how-to get django-sqlalchemy up and running your project.

Dependancies
------------

Make sure you have the following installed on your PYTHONPATH:

    * sqlalchemy 0.4.5 -- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SQLAlchemy/0.4.5
    * django "queryset-refactor" -- svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/queryset-refactor 

As of r7426 in the queryset-refactor branch has broken django-sqlalchemy. You
might want to make sure you have a checkout prior to that changeset or wait
until we fix it in our core.
